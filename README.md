### Step 5

At the top-left corner, click Install Engine. The launcher will take you 
to a screen where you can select which components to install.

### Step 6

Note: Epic Games is constantly updating Unreal Engine, so your engine
version may be slightly different than this. For example, since I wrote
the first draft of this tutorial, the version has already updated to 4.14.3!
As long as you have at least version 4.14, you should be set for this tutorial.
